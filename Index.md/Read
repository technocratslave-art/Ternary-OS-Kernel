README.md
Purpose, threat model, and invariants. One page. No fluff.

What Ternary-OS is (and is not)

Non-goals (no learning, no personalization, no cloud dependency)

Release tag + hash




1. CONSTITUTION

/constitution/TERNARY_OS_CONSTITUTION.md

This is the law. Everything else must conform.

Subsections:

1. Immutable Soul


2. Ephemeral Breath


3. Sterile Bridge


4. Physical Enforcement


5. Violation Conditions (what constitutes a broken system)



No implementation details here—only rules.



2. ARCHITECTURE SPINE

/docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md

This explains how the laws are obeyed.

Subsections:

Rail Model Overview (Rail-1 / Rail-2 / Rail-3 / State-0)

Power Domains & Physical Isolation

Dataflow Diagram (Sensors → Airlock → Reasoning → Airlock → UI)

What can never talk to what (explicit deny table)


This is where diagrams live.



3. MEMORY MODEL

/docs/architecture/MEMORY_MODEL.md

Defines what exists and how long it may exist.

Subsections:

Immutable Memory (Weights, Centroid Dictionary)

Ephemeral Memory (KV Cache, Scratch, Activations)

Scar Capsule (allowed payload, max size, lifecycle)

Forbidden Memory (examples)


This is the anti-ego section.


4. THE HINGE

/docs/architecture/HINGE_ENFORCEMENT.md

The heart of the system.

Subsections:

Electrical Definition of the Hinge

500ms Timer Source

SRAM Discharge Requirements

What is wiped vs what remains powered

Verification methodology (how to prove it happened)


No metaphors here—only physics.



5. SCAR CAPSULE

/docs/scar/SCAR_CAPSULE_SPEC.md

Defines the only state allowed to cross death.

Subsections:

Allowed Data Types (Concept IDs only)

Explicitly Forbidden Data

Size Limits

Signing & Verification (State-0)

Replay & Tamper Rejection


This should read like a crypto spec.


6. CENTROID DICTIONARY

/docs/scar/CENTROID_DICTIONARY.md

Your appendix, formalized.

Subsections:

Derivation Corpus & Rationale

Clustering Method (k-means, dimensionality, k)

Frozen Invariant Policy

Collision & Ambiguity Strategy

Hashing & Attestation (optional v1.1 note)


This is where “facts without vibe” is mathematically enforced.



7. KV POLICY (FACT EXTRACTION)

/docs/runtime/KV_POLICY.md

Explains how facts are extracted before death.

Subsections:

Topic Head Selection

Stability Window

Cross-Head Consensus

Style Probe Rejection

Discretization Pipeline

Failure Modes (when nothing survives)


Reference kv_policy.c here—don’t duplicate code.



8. RUNTIME (RAIL-3)

/runtime/rail3/

Code, not philosophy.

Files:

rail3_runtime.c

ternary_npu.h

ternary_sw_backend.c

hinge_state.h


README in this folder:

Execution lifecycle

Where the hinge fires

What must be zero after each cycle



9. AIRLOCK (STATE-0)

/runtime/airlock/

Governance and enforcement.

Subsections (README):

Validation Rules

Scar Signing

Dictionary Verification

Drop Conditions (silent discard rules)


This is the judge, not a participant.



10. HARDWARE REFERENCE

/hardware/REFERENCE_DESIGN.md

Bench-buildable, not aspirational.

Subsections:

Rail Mapping to Physical Components

Power Domains

Reset Lines

Clock Sources

What cannot be shared



11. PROTOTYPE BOM

/hardware/PROTOTYPE_BOM.md

Your existing list, cleaned and frozen.

Subsections:

Core Hardware

Measurement Equipment

Why each item exists (one line each)



12. TEST & AUDIT

/tests/SOVEREIGN_AUDIT.md

Proof, not promises.

Subsections:

Hinge Wipe Test

Needle Injection Test

Reconstruction Attack Test

Thermal & Bandwidth Limits

Pass/Fail Criteria


If a test fails, the system is not sovereign.



13. RELEASE LOCK

/RELEASE.md

Version tag

Git commit hash

Constitution hash

Centroid dictionary hash

Signed statement of invariants


This is the notarization page.


Final Note

This spine does one critical thing:
it separates law, physics, and code.

Law cannot be “optimized.”

Physics cannot be “patched.”

Code is disposable as long as it obeys both.
