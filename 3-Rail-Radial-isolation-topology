## 3-Rail Radial Isolation Topology (Endgame Anchor)

This diagram is the *endgame anchor* of the project: the kernel is not a bridge to “everywhere.”  
It is a *hub* that enforces deterministic doors.

### The Hub (Blue)
The Blue Hub is the trusted authority plane. It is intentionally small and boring.

It owns:
- identity and keys
- invariant sets (“needles”)
- audit root / append-only events
- capability minting + revocation
- hinge control (reset policy, restart authority)

If a component cannot be expressed as a capability with a bounded contract, it does not belong in the hub.

### The Rails (Untrusted Domains)
The outer rings are rails: separate execution + I/O domains that can run rich stacks and still be treated as compromised.

**Rail 1 — Sensor Rail**
- camera / mic / GPS / IMU / biometrics ingress
- never gets a direct path to reasoning or identity
- data must cross the Sensor Airlock (State 0) for downgrade, rate limits, timestamping, and policy transforms

**Rail 2 — Media Rail**
- GPU, display, video, audio pipelines
- designed for “zero-copy” passthrough where possible (capability-controlled DMA mappings)
- all bridges to identity, storage, or reasoning must cross the Media Airlock (State 0)

**Rail 3 — Reasoning Rail**
- optional LLM/agent workloads live here
- treated as untrusted by default (jailbreaks, hostile documents, prompt injection are assumed)
- receives only bounded artifacts through the Reasoning Airlock (State 0)

The rails can be powerful. They are not authoritative.

### The Airlocks (Purple)
Airlocks are the only legal bridges between domains.

An Airlock is a State-0 component with hard requirements:
- non-executable shared window (or minimal gate code with no allocation)
- fixed-size buffers
- deterministic runtime (bounded time, bounded memory)
- explicit result codes: ALLOW / REDACT / VIOLATION
- explicit output locations and lifetimes

Airlocks exist to prevent “convenience tunnels” from slowly becoming the real system.

### Bay-0 (Control Plane)
Bay-0 is the non-performing observer/orchestrator role:
- no heavy compute
- no learning
- no context accumulation
- budgets, orchestration, and kill/restart authority routing

Bay-0 exists to keep the rails from growing into a shadow OS.

### The Hinge (Temporal Discontinuity)
The hinge is scheduled discontinuity:
- rail memory is flushed/restarted on policy or clock
- caches and scratch state are destroyed
- compromised domains lose continuity

This converts long-lived compromise into short-lived compromise.

### The Scar (Continuity Without Accumulation)
If the reasoning rail needs orientation across hinge cycles, it does not receive full history.

It receives a bounded continuity artifact (“scar”), e.g. a fixed 64-byte authenticated hash output,
sufficient to re-orient the next cycle without carrying raw context forward.

Memory is transient. Continuity is hashed.
