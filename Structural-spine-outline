This is the kernel as a single, unified thing (no fracture)
The Ternary Kernel consists of exactly these parts, and no more:
System topology (ternary.system)
This is the kernel’s body.
It defines what can see what, and what can never see what.
Bay-0 Monitor (monitor.c)
This is the kernel’s will.
It does not parse, reason, or decide.
It only enforces and kills.
State-0 Airlock (airlock lib)
This is the kernel’s hands.
Deterministic, bounded, stateless transformation only.
Capability ABI (ternary_contract.h)
This is the kernel’s law.
No vibes, no interpretation, no hidden channels.
Hinge / Restart semantics
This is the kernel’s immune system.
Violation → discontinuity → reset.
