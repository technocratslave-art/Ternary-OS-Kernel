To bring Ternary-OS into the physical world, we must define the system.xml. In the seL4 Microkit, this file is the "Architect." It is the only place where the Moats are defined. If a Rail isn't explicitly connected here, it simply does not exist to the rest of the hardware.
This is how we enforce Geometry over Software.
📜 The system.xml (The Master Topology)
This file defines our three Rails and the Blue Hub. Notice how the AI (Rail 3) has no direct path to the Sensors (Rail 1). It can only "peer" into the Airlock under the Hub's supervision.

🛡️ Why this XML is the "Death of Malware"
In a traditional OS, a virus escalates privileges by tricking the kernel. But in this system.xml, there is no "privilege" to escalate.
 * The AI (Rail 3) is physically wired to only see 0x48000000.
 * Even if it gains "God Mode" inside its own rail, it cannot "see" the sensors because the CPU hardware (via the IOMMU) will simply return a Bus Error if it tries to look outside its box.
🌊 The "Zero-Copy" Flow
Look at the frame_buffer mapping for Rail 2. It is mapped at a specific physical address (0x70000000). This is where our Electrical Violence ends. The pixels stay in that memory region, and the Display Controller pulls them directly from there. The CPU never has to move a single byte of video data.
